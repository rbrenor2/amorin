# AI Usage Documentation

## Tools Used

- **GitHub Copilot**: AI pair programmer
- **Claude (via Copilot Chat)**: Conversational AI assistant

## How AI Was Used

AI tools assisted with specific peripheral tasks during development:

### Documentation

- **README.md**: Generated project documentation, setup instructions, and feature descriptions
- **Code Comments**: Helped write inline documentation

### Boilerplate Code

- **DTOs**: Generated `create_todo.dto.dart` and `update_profile.dto.dart` with standard `toJson()`/`fromJson()` patterns
- **Service Interfaces**: Created abstract repository contracts and service class structures
- **Widget Scaffolding**: Initial stateful/stateless widget boilerplate
- **Form Controllers**: TextEditingController initialization and disposal patterns

### Development Support

- Accessing Flutter/Dart documentation and API references
- Code formatting and import organization
- Standard CRUD operation patterns

## Human-Driven Development

All core application features, architecture decisions, business logic, and user experience design were human-implemented. AI served only as a productivity tool for documentation and repetitive code patterns.
